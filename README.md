# M17_inet

[M17](https://m17foundation.org/) is a modern open source digital radio protocol built by hams, for hams. This repository contains the specification of the M17 Internet interface, while the air interface is specified in https://github.com/M17-Project/M17_spec. It is still a work in progress, meaning that this repository is meant to be updated now and then.
